# Simple_OS_Simulation_G52OSC

Process Scheduling, Operating System APIs, Threading, and Concurrency

The goal of this project is to make use of operating system APIs (specifically, the POSIX API in Linux) 
and simple concurrency directives to solve a number of synchronisation problems that occur on scheduling 
systems that are similar to the ones that you may find in fairly simple operating systems.The project 
is divided into multiple sub-tasks with different difficulty levels and multiple deadlines. The later 
tasks will build upon the experience and knowledge you have gained in the earlier tasks.

Completing all tasks will give you a good understanding of:

• The use of operating system APIs in Linux.

• Critical sections, semaphores, mutexes, and the principles of synchronisation/mutual exclusion.

• Basic process/thread scheduling algorithms and evaluation criteria for process scheduling.

• The implementation of linear bounded and unbounded buffers using linked lists.

• The basics of concurrent/parallel programming using an operating system’s functionalities.

• Different process scheduling algorithms and the working of the scheduling algorithm in Windows 7.
